        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Hi! Welcome to the EV Hub. We want to be super clear about how we handle your privacy, and it's pretty simple: we don't collect or store your personal information.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">
            This policy explains how the website works and what happens with any information you interact with.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4 border-b-2 pb-2">What We Collect (And What We Don't)</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            We built this website with your privacy in mind. This means:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-8">
            <li>
                <strong>We don't collect any personal data.</strong> We don't ask for your name, email address, or any other identifying information. There are no user accounts, so we have no way to track who you are.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>We don't use cookies.</strong> You won't find any cookies on our site for tracking, advertising, or personalization.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>We don't store your data.</strong> Any information you interact with on the site stays in your web browser.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4 border-b-2 pb-2">How We Use Your Information (The AI Tools)</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The only time any information leaves your computer is when you use the AI Tools section. When you type a question into the "Ask the EV AI" box, your text is sent to a third-party service to get a response. This process is immediate and is not stored by us.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4 border-b-2 pb-2">Third-Party Services</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            To provide the AI functionality, we use Google's generative AI models. When you submit a question in the AI section, your query is sent directly to Google's servers.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-8">
            <li>
                Your interaction with their service is governed by their privacy policy, which you can read here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Please note:</strong> The text you provide to the AI is used by Google to generate a response. We don't have access to or store this information.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4 border-b-2 pb-2">Changes to this Policy</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">
            We might update this policy in the future to reflect any changes to the website. We'll post the new policy here with the updated date at the top.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4 border-b-2 pb-2">Contact Us</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700">
            If you have any questions about this privacy policy, feel free to ask me, and I'll do my best to provide clarity.
